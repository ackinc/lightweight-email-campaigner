# Lightweight Email Campaigner

Tool to send multi-stage email campaigns to a list of recipients;
the original version of this tool was built in a 3-day sprint

## To do

This is a wishlist of nice-to-haves that are probably never going
to be implemented

- scheduling campaigns to start execution at a future time
- matching email delivery time with lead's timezone
- admin role (currently, users see only the campaigns they created)
- allowing body of campaign email to be specified as markdown
- allow user to choose from styled email templates when creating campaign
- attachments in campaign emails
- jwt expiry extension (when used near expiry date)
- limit origins for CORS
